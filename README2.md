These Exercises are part of the Odin Prjects Foundations learning path.

By solving the exercises I learned how to use a test file to see if the code runs and executes as expexted with different test cases.
I used several Javascript concepts like loops, conditionals, arrays and its methods and learned different ways to round numbers.
